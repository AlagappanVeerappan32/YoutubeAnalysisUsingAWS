# YouTube Analysis with AWS: Data Engineering Pipelines

## Project Overview:
Welcome to our YouTube Analysis project, where we leverage the power of AWS to conduct comprehensive analyses on YouTube data. In this era of data-driven decision-making, understanding the intricacies of video popularity and audience engagement is crucial for content creators, marketers, and businesses alike. Our project aims to provide valuable insights into YouTube content through robust data engineering pipelines and advanced analytics.

## Key Objectives:
Launching New Data-Driven Campaigns: By harnessing the wealth of data available on YouTube, we empower users to make informed decisions when launching new campaigns, ensuring maximum reach and impact.

Channel Analysis: Dive deep into YouTube channels to understand their content, audience demographics, and performance metrics. Identify trends, strengths, and areas for improvement to optimize content strategy.

Video Categorization: Utilize comments, views, likes, and other metrics to categorize videos effectively. Whether it's entertainment, education, or tutorials, our analysis helps classify content for targeted audiences.

Factors Affecting Video Popularity: Explore the multitude of factors that influence a video's popularity on YouTube. From engagement metrics to timing and content type, uncover the secrets behind viral videos and optimize your own content for success.

## Technologies Used:

Amazon Web Services (AWS): Leveraging AWS services such as S3, EMR, Lambda, and Athena, we build scalable and efficient data pipelines for processing, storing, and analyzing YouTube data.

Python: Our project is built using Python, harnessing its versatility and rich ecosystem of libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Apache Spark: Employing Apache Spark for distributed data processing, we handle large volumes of YouTube data with speed and efficiency, enabling comprehensive analysis in real-time.

## Steps

1. Download the Dataset from Kaggle:
Download the dataset from Kaggle and save it locally.

2. Create an S3 Bucket:
Create an S3 bucket on AWS to store the dataset and processed data.

3. Upload the Dataset to S3 Bucket:
Upload the dataset to the created S3 bucket.

4. Preprocess and Clean the Data:
Preprocess and clean the dataset to prepare it for analysis.

5. Store the Cleaned Data to S3 Bucket:
Upload the cleaned data to the S3 bucket.

6. Setup S3 Bucket Event Notification:
Configure an S3 bucket event notification to trigger a Lambda function for each object put event.

7. Create a Lambda Function:
Create a Lambda function and execute the logic to preprocess the data.

8. Utilize AWS Wrangler Library:
We utilize the AWS Wrangler library for S3 and Glue operations, providing better efficiency.

9. Create a Glue Data Catalog:
Create a Glue Data Catalog to store metadata about the dataset.

10. Create a Glue Crawler:
Create a Glue Crawler to crawl the data stored in the S3 bucket and update the Glue Data Catalog.

11. Query the Data using Athena:
Query the data using Amazon Athena to gain insights and perform analysis.

12. Store the Output Data in S3 Bucket:
Store the output data generated from the analysis back into the S3 bucket.

13. Visualize Data with QuickSight:
Utilize Amazon QuickSight for visualization of the analyzed data.
